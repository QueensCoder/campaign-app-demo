# Document 2: Non-Technical Overview for Stakeholders

## 1. Project Overview

**Objective:** Develop a modern web application using Next.js, deployed on
Vercel, with user authentication, OAuth integration, data reporting
capabilities, and a connection to a PostgreSQL database. **Why TypeScript and
Next.js:**

## Why Next.js and Typescript

- **TypeScript:** Chosen for its strong typing, which helps catch errors early
  and improves code quality. It also enhances developer productivity with better
  tooling and autocompletion.
- **Next.js:** Selected for its ease of use and powerful features like
  server-side rendering and static site generation. It simplifies the
  development process and improves performance.
- **Vercel:** Provides seamless deployment and hosting for Next.js applications,
  making it easy to get started and scale.
- **Onboarding Engineers:** The combination of TypeScript and Next.js allows for
  quick onboarding of new engineers due to their popularity and extensive
  documentation.
- **Unified Language:** Using JavaScript/TypeScript for both frontend and
  backend development reduces context switching, making the development process
  more efficient.

**Key Features:**

- User authentication and management via Clerk.
- OAuth login options (e.g., Google, GitHub).
- Data reporting and visualization.
- Secure connection to a PostgreSQL database.

## 2. Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js (React framework for server-rendered applications).
- **Hosting:** Vercel (cloud platform for static sites and serverless
  functions).
- **Authentication:** Clerk (user management and authentication).
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (relational database).
- **Data Visualization:** Chart.js (JavaScript library for charts).

## 3. User Authentication

**Clerk Integration:**

- Provides a seamless user authentication experience.
- Supports OAuth for easy login via Google, GitHub, etc.
- Manages user sessions and security.

## 4. Data Management

**PostgreSQL Database:**

- Stores application data securely.
- Scalable and reliable for handling large datasets.

**Data Reporting:**

- Interactive charts and graphs to visualize data.
- Customizable reports based on user needs.

## 5. Deployment and Hosting

**Vercel:**

- Ensures fast and reliable deployment.
- Provides automatic scaling and high availability.
- Offers a seamless integration with Next.js.

## 6. Security and Compliance

**Data Security:**

- All data is encrypted in transit and at rest.
- Secure user authentication with Clerk.

**Compliance:**

- Adherence to industry standards for data protection and privacy.

## 7. Timeline and Milestones

- **Week 1-2:** Project setup and initial development.
- **Week 3-4:** Integration of authentication and database.
- **Week 5-6:** Development of data reporting features.
- **Week 7:** Testing and final deployment.

## 8. Next Steps

**Feedback and Iteration:**

- Gather feedback from stakeholders.
- Iterate on features and improvements.

**Ongoing Maintenance:**

- Regular updates and security patches.
- Continuous monitoring and optimization.
